# Five Pandas classes

1. **DataFrame**: A two-dimensional, size-mutable, heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns) that provides powerful data manipulation and analysis capabilities.  
2. **Series**: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type, providing fast vectorized operations and automatic alignment based on its index.  
3. **Index**: An immutable sequence used to label and align data along an axis in Pandas objects, enabling efficient lookups and joins.  
4. **Categorical**: A dtype for pandas that represents variables with a finite set of possible values, offering memory efficiency and performance improvements for repeated values.  
5. **Timestamp**: An enhanced replacement for Pythonâ€™s datetime object within pandas, supporting nanosecond resolution and vectorized time-series operations.
